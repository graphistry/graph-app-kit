# Developer Guide

These instructions are for contributing to this repository. See main README.md for usage.

## Manual

```bash
cd src/docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## Test

### CI

CI will trigger on pushes to PRs

### Security scans

We use [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) to check for issues in both the base Graphistry container and the added `g-a-k` layers

Scans run daily

### Local

To test locally:

```bash
cd src/python
./bin/lint.sh
python3 -m pytest test
```

This is expected to change as full docker-based testing lands

### AWS

* Modify `src/bootstraps/core/graphistry.yml` on the checkout step do use the branch:  `git clone -b mybranch`
* Push your branch
* In CloudFormation, upload your modified `graphistry.yml``

## Aligned base versions

For faster AWS launches, we:

- Keep the docker base (docker-compose.yml::GRAPHISTRY_FORGE_BASE_VERSION) in sync w/ AWS version

- Update aws version (bootstraps/*/graphistry.yml) by pointing to that version's region AMIs via bootstraps/scripts/graphistry-ami-list.sh
  * Setup: `apt-get install awscli jq` and `aws configure`
  * Run `src/bootstraps/scripts $ VERSION=2.36.6-11.0 ./graphistry-ami-list.sh`
  * Paste into `src/bootstraps/core,neptune/graphistry.yml`
  * Update `src/docker/docker-compose.yml::GRAPHISTRY_FORGE_BASE_VERSION`

## Automated Builds

Managed via DockerHub automated builds

* Master merge updates tag `latest`
* Git tags ('v1.2.3') publish to the DockerHub repo for each service
* Failed builds do not publish

See [current tags](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/graphistry/graph-app-kit-st)

## Publish

* Docker rebuilds on merge to main
* Push main tag ('v1.2.3') for building named versions
* CloudFormation templates uploaded to S3 upon a PR being labeled "publish", merge-to-main, or explicit GHA call
