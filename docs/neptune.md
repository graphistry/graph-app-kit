# Quick launch Amazon Neptune and graph-app-kit

[Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) is a:

> ... &quot;fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets&quot;

Amazon Neptune supports both property graph queries with [Apache Gremlin/Tinkerpop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/) queries, and RDF graphs with SPAQL queries. By using `graph-app-kit` with Amazon Neptune, you can visually explore graph database data and share point-and-click dashboard tools. 

This guides walks through quick launch scripts for Neptune and Neptune-aware `graph-app-kit`. Alternatively, you may follow our [manual Neptune setup guide](neptune-manual.md). 

## 1. Setup Amazon Neptune with identity graph demo data

Launch using a button at the bottom of the [identity graph sample cloud formation templates tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/building-a-customer-identity-graph-with-amazon-neptune/):


1. Click the `Launch Stack` button for your region:
  * The recommended full `graph-app-kit` quick launcher requires a GPU instance:
     * ... So ensure Neptune is in a region where you have `g4dn`/`p3`/`p4` GPU quota [or request it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html)
  * The minimal `graph-app-kit` quick launcher can run without a GPU, but also does not come with Jupyter, public/private dashboards, etc.
2. Check the acknowledgement boxes in the `Capabilities` section
3. Click `Create Stack` (5-20min)
  *  OUTPUT: The root `Identity-Graph-Sample` item's `Output` tab will show values used to configure the next steps:

      * `VPC`: ID `vpc-abc`
      * `PublicSubnet1`: ID `subnet-abc`
      * `DBClusterReadEndpoint`: URL `abc.cluster-ro-xyz.zzz.neptune.amazonaws.com`

----

**Manage:**

* **Neptune UI**: AWS console -> `Services` -> `Neptune` -> `Databases`

* **Stack**: At any time, inspect the template's generated AWS resources and `delete` them:
	*  `AWS Console` -> `Services` -> `CloudFormation` -> `Stacks` 

* **Resize ($)**: Upon completed launch, resize Neptune to a cheaper instance: 
  * Got to the above Neptune UI -> `Databases` -> **Modify** the **Writer**
  * Change *DB instance class* to *db.r4.large* -> `Continue` -> check **Apply immediately** -> `Modify DB Instance`

## 2. Launch graph-app-kit configured for Amazon Neptune

**Option 1 - Full (Recommended):** 

  * GPU EC2 instance in your Neptune VPC
  * Start making views for Neptune data immediately
  * Web-based live editing
  * Included: Graphistry, public + private Streamlit dashboards, Jupyter notebooks, RAPIDS.ai Python GPU ecosystem

  [![Launch Stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=region#/stacks/new?stackName=graph_app_kit_full&templateURL=https://graph-app-kit-repo-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/templates/latest/neptune/graphistry.yml)
  
  If AWS reports `Please select another region`, use the `Select a Region` dropdown in the top right menu.

**Option 2 - Minimal:**

  * CPU EC2 instance in your Neptune VPC
  * Create Neptune views from your terminal
  * Included: Public Streamlit dashboards linked against a remote Graphistry account
  * Not included: Local Graphistry, private dashboards, Jupyter, RAPIDS.ai

  Get a free or self-managed [Graphistry server account](https://www.graphistry.com/get-started) with username+pass then [launch a minimal stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=region#/stacks/new?stackName=graph_app_kit_full&templateURL=https://graph-app-kit-repo-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/templates/latest/neptune/graphistry.yml)
  
  If AWS reports `Please select another region`, use the `Select a Region` dropdown in the top right menu.

----

1. **Launch configuration: Details parameters**

  1. Set stack name to anything, such as `graph-app-kit-a`
  1. Set `VPC` to the `VPC` ID value ("`vpc-...`") from `1. Setup Amazon Neptune`
  1. Set `Subnet` to the `PublicSubnet1` subnet ID value ("`subnet-...`") from `1. Setup Amazon Neptune`
  1. Set `GraphAppKitKeyPair` to any where you have the SSH private.key

  If using the minimal template, fill in details for your Graphistry account

2. ***(Optional):*** **Monitor instance launch for progress and errors**

  * Click the `Resources` tab and follow the link to the EC2 instance AWS console page after it gets generated

  * Click on the instance to find its public IP address
  
  * Login and watch:

  ```bash
  ssh -i /my/private.key ubuntu@the.instance.public.ip 
  ### ssh -i /my/private.key ec2-user@the.instance.public.ip for Minimal launcher

  tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log -n 1000
  ```

## 3. Graph!

* Go to your public Streamlit dashboard: http://[the.public.ip.address]/public/dash
* Select `GREMLIN: SIMPLE SAMPLE` from the dropdown to load a random sample of nodes from whatever Neptune database is connected

### Login

* Upon launch completion, you will have a full suite of graph tools located at **http://[the.public.ip.address]**

* Web login using credentials **`admin`** / ***`i-theInstanceID`*** 

* SSH using the instructions from step 2

* ***Note***: The minimal launcher has no web admin portal, just SSH and Streamlit

### URLs for full stack 

* **Graphistry: GPU-accelerated visual analytics + account login**
  * **http://[the.public.ip.address]**
  * Login as `admin` / `your-aws-instance-id`
